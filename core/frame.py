This file contains the general framework that will integrate
all the layers.

This is a RAW draft, so there are not a lot of layers.
Just the basic and famous ones.

Layers to implement:

Learnable Layer:
	Dense Layer
	Batch Normalization Layer

	Conv Layer
	Dropout Layer (maybe)
	Pooling Layer (maybe)

Nonlinearity:
	ReLu
	Sigmoid

Loss Function:
	Softmax

Gradient Decent:
	SGD
	Adam (maybe)
